## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What does `strictly equal` mean? -Strictly equal measures if both the value and data type of the value are the same. It returns a "true" value if both measurements are the same and "false" if only one or neither measurements are the same.

- What is the logical **and** operator? -The logical **and** operator is formatted as "&&" and checks if both operands are true. A "true" result only appears if both operands are true; a "false result will appear if only one operand is true or if neither operand is true.

- Can you name some comparison operators? -There are the "greater than" comparison operator (>), the "greater than or equal" comparison operator (>=), and their "less than" equivalents (< and <=).
