## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the five parts of a function definition?
  -the 5 parts of a function definition syntax are:

  1. the function keyword that begins to create the function,
  2. the optional that's not actually optional to include but can be whatever you want (as long as it follows camelCasing),
  3. a list of parameters that can be as few as zero but are separated by commas if there are more than one,
  4. the code block indicated by the curly brackes {},
  5. the the optional return statement that initiates a method to be fulfilled when the parameters are replaced by arguments.

- How do you call a function?
  -Once you define a function, you can type the name of the function to call it and run the code in the block.
  -You can also add arguments within the parentheses of the called function to replace the parameters and change the result of the function.
  -The function can be called on its own or assigned to a variable to call it.

- What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
  -Parameters are placeholders that allow the code block within the defined function to run when the function is called.
  -Arguments are the elements added to a called function that replace the parameters and produce a result from the code block.

## Notes

All student notes should be written here.
Math.PI is a static value you can add to add pi to your math. I found that out through Google to complete the getCircleCircumference function.
Math.pow(x, y) is a method to basically write x to the power of y. So, for the cubed function, math.pow(5, 3) is how you get 5 to the power of 3, or "5 cubed."
