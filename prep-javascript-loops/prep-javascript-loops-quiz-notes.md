## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops? - As a boolean expression, the condition ensures the loop does not run infinitely by checking if the stated condition is true and preventing the loop from running if the statement is false.

- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated? -The initialization is checked before the loop runs and is checked first. The initialization value defines the variable used in the condition, thereby telling the loop when to start and helping the condition return a boolean result.

- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated? -The condition is checked before the loop runs and is checked second. If the condition (still) returns a true result, the loop runs. If the condition result is false, the loop will not run.

- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated? -The final expression is checked after each run so that the initialization value is updated before repeating the loop process.

- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop? -The final expression changes the value of the initialization and therefore eventually cause the condition to be false. so that it is impossible for the loop to run forever.

- What types of data should the `for...in` loop be used on? -for...in loops work with the properties held within objects.
