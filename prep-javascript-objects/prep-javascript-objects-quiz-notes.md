## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What data types can object properties hold? -Objects can hold any primitive data types.

- Describe the syntax (structure) of object-literals in JavaScript. - once you declare your object (variable), you create curly brackets after the assignment operator. Then, you add property value keys between the curly brackets by naming a property (variable), followed by a colon, followed by the assigned data (string, number, or boolean value), then completed with a comma. You can fit multiple property value keys within an object literal syntax.
